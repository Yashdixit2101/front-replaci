## 🏗 Deployment

You can deploy this application using Docker to any cloud provider that supports containerized applications, such as AWS, DigitalOcean, or Google Cloud.

1. Build the production image:

   docker build -t react-app:latest .
   ```
2. Push to a container registry (Docker Hub, AWS ECR, etc.)
3. Deploy using Kubernetes, Docker Compose, or directly via the cloud provider.
